First [https://code.google.com/p/gtv-ui-lib/downloads/detail?name=codewalk-start.zip download archive with simple HTML for this codelab] and take a look at it. All it does is:
  * bootstraps Closure Library along with tv.ui.Decoration code in HEAD element,
  * imports necessary components using goog.require(),
  * contains basic CSS styles that defines the page,
  * contains HTML only for part of above page, rest of it is commented as it will be explained later.


If you would have some problems, you can [https://code.google.com/p/gtv-ui-lib/downloads/detail?name=codewalk-final.zip download final result of the codelab].

Now let’s take a closer look at page logic that we want to create.

Toolkit does not construct any HTML on the fly. It’s designed to decorate existing HTML in order to make components out of it and add dynamics to it. Decoration is based on conventions by adding special CSS classes to HTML elements (all of those have “tv-” prefix). Let’s take a look at already downloaded example.

{{{
// Top level container is declared as vertical container. Note that
// additional styles can be applied for customization.
<div class="tv-container-vertical main-container">
  // Declares horizontal container that holds two buttons.
  <div class="tv-container-horizontal buttons-container">
    // “alert button” and “go to google.com”
  </div>
  // Declares vertical container that holds shelves.
  <div class="tv-container-vertical shelves">
    // “shelves” with images
  </div>
</div>
