#summary [Closure] How to write custom component

= Writing custom component =

== Checking your reasons ==

TV UI library designed in a way most tasks could be accomplished without writing your own component. Do so only if your goal is code reuse. Otherwise you probably doing something wrong.

== Extending base class ==

Choose a base class to extend. All TV UI classes are designed with extensibility in mind, so feel free to choose the one that best suits your needs. That said, a usual candidate is {{{tv.ui.Component}}}.

{{{
// Provide a class name for your component.
goog.provide('acme.Button');

// Require base class.
goog.require('tv.ui.Component');

/**
 * @constructor
 * @extends {tv.ui.Component}
 */
acme.Button = function() {
  // Donâ€™t forget to call a constructor of base class.
  goog.base(this);

  // ...rest of initialization code...
};
// Actually inherit your class from base.
goog.inherits(acme.Button, tv.ui.Component);
}}}
